Book.Py
You do not need to input the Author of the book! You can just leave that space blank!
book.py when run will search a small list of websites for the book you typed in then display those websites. 
You can read the html to make sure that it is the boook you want as well as that it will be the first page.


Bookpdf.py
For bookpdf.py you need the DejaVuSansCondensed.ttf in the same directory as the .py and then
you will be able to essentially do the same as book.py but it will give you a pdf and a txt file

Thats it y'all if you want more links added to search for books on that website
